# YouTube Clone
YouTube clone made with pure HTML and CSS. This website is best viewed on desktops.
I made this website as a challenge, it was really hard to make with pure CSS.

<p> This website was not made for mobile viewports. Best viewed on desktops with vw > 786px. The CSS Grid collapses on smaller devices, as the flexbox takes up entire width of the viewport.</p>
